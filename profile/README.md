The NRDCG (Natural Reserve of DNS Clients in Go) is a protected area for DNS clients in Go.

We welcome within this organization:
- original DNS clients
- maintained fork of DNS clients

If you have a maintained fork (of an unmaintained library) or created a DNS client and want to manage your repository with a team, you can create a discussion [here]([https://github.com/nrdcg/.github/issues](https://github.com/orgs/nrdcg/discussions)) to explain your situation and we will be happy to welcome you and your repository.

The organization is community-based: members manage the organization.
